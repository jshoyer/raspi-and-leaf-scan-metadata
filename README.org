Metadata, code, and other documentation
for time-course analyses
of /A. thaliana/ growth
with Raspberry Pi cameras
and flatbed scanners.
I am going to gradually release
more datasets acquired in 2016 and 2017
on Zenodo
and similarly push
better (machine-readable) metadata
and annotations (ground truth labels)
to Zenodo
via this repository.
